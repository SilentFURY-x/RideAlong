**RideAlong** is a smart carpooling platform designed for university students to coordinate rides to airports and railway stations. It eliminates the chaos of WhatsApp groups, helping students save money and reduce their carbon footprint.

## 🧐 The Problem
Every holiday season, students face the same struggle:
* 📱 **Spam:** College WhatsApp groups are flooded with hundreds of "Anyone going to the airport?" messages.
* 📉 **Inefficiency:** Requests get buried in chat history, leading to missed opportunities.
* 💸 **Cost:** Many end up traveling alone and paying 4x the price because they couldn't find a partner in time.

## 💡 The Solution
**RideAlong** replaces the noise with a clean, centralized dashboard.
* **Structured Listings:** No more scrolling. Filter rides by Date, Time, and Destination.
* **Privacy First:** Connect with verified student emails. No phone numbers shared until a request is accepted.
* **Real-Time Coordination:** A "Request & Accept" system ensures seats are booked fairly.
